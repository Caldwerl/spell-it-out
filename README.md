Small code challenge involving numbers and letters

If all the integers between 1 and 123 are spelled out in English with no spaces or conjunctions and compiled into a single string, answer these questions once:

1. what is the total length of the string
2. if a letter was selected at random from the string, what is the empirical probability it will be letter 'e'. ?
